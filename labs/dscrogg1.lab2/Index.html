        <article>&emsp;Paul Pelosi is a star stock trader making lots of noise on Wall Street. Beating the market by 20% in 2020, even hedge funds ache to reach his level of success. In July of this year, Mr. Pelosi sold 25,000 shares of microchip manufacturer Nvidia. <br> This was just a month before Nvidia's stock price dropped by 12 percent, saving Mr. Pelosi $600,000 in potential losses. In March of 2021, Mr. Pelosi exercised options to buy $5 million dollars worth of Microsoft shares. Less than two weeks later, <br> the U.S. Army announced a $21.9 billion dollar deal for augmented reality headsets. Needless to say, share price increased substantially after this announcement, and wow! did Mr. Pelosi's options call payout. He is definitely a player to watch in the future.
